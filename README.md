##the Evolution of Site Design with Web Components

All of these source code examples are in support of a talk I gave at <a href="http://bigdesigndallas.com/sessions/the-evolution-of-site-design-with-web-components/">Big Design Conference.</a>

This example app uses web components that I implemented via the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org">Google Polymer library.</a>

Accompanying <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KaDawg/presentations">presentation slides provide useful context.</a>

## The Code

Two sub pages exist from the main one. Click on both seeing how **buttons** and **the tv-listing** components demo. Look under the hood at all the code to learn some of what's possible. Much more exists to the Polymer library. Far past what I've done.

When you clone the repo you'll notice the bower configuration. `bower install` on that to drag down dependencies to your puter.

## My Book

If you like my work please check out my book. You might find it the most awesome jumpstart into brining a new level of tools into your workflow. Especially if you're a designer, developer, or creative leader.

The book is published by the fine folks at Focal Press.
It's called **Responsive Web Design Toolkit: Hammering Websites Into Shape** and you can <a href="http://www.hammeringresponsivewebdesign.com/">read more about it when you want to.</a>

It took me about 2 years to make the book, but only you can make it a success. Please buy it, leave a great review on Amazon, and socalize it among your network.
